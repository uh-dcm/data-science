One way to achieve this is to use the [elbow_ method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbow_method_(clustering)), where we visually inspect the best number of topics. Other tools exists as well, such as the [Silhouette method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silhouette_(clustering)). Elbow is simple, but not always that clear and other methods are preferred. However, it is easy to understand.\n",

It can range from 0 (all items in the clusters are at the same point as its centroid) to positive infinity (nodes are all over the place). When numer or clusters (k) is increased, it decreases SSE; but this is a balancing act: how do you balance between more clusters and additional complexity and most explainability?"
